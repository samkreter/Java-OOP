 * Note* my output is out of order from the document using the treemap instead of the ArrayList because
 * i used a cocatenated string of the ocupation and the name and the treemap orders them in sorted order
 * 
 * 
 * Treemap in many cases is more efficent than an arraylist becuase elements can be accessed in O(1) time or constant 
 * time. This is because a treemap uses a hash bucket system to places the corrisponding key values into certian hashes and 
 * will store the keys in sorted order mean it is not only possible to access a certain key value pair in constant time but
 * also have the data sorted for easier access through an iterative way.
